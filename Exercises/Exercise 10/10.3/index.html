            Among Us is a popular online multiplayer game developed by InnerSloth that was released in 2018. In the game, players are crew members aboard a spaceship, and their goal is to identify and vote off the "impostors" among them before the impostors can kill all the crew members or sabotage the ship. The game can be played with 4 to 10 players, and each player is randomly assigned the role of either a crew member or an impostor. The game has gained widespread popularity due to its simple yet engaging gameplay, social dynamics, and the ability to play with friends or strangers online.
